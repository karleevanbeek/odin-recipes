        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>7 Tbsp butter, cold</li>
            <li>One heaped cup of blueberries, fresh or frozen</li>
            <li>1 ½ Tbsp lemon zest</li>
            <li>100g discard sourdough starter</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2-3 Tbsp milk or pouring cream, plus more for brushing</li>
            <li>1 ½Tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>90g powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder and mix them well together. Cut the cold butter into cubes and add it to the flour. Use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into small pea-sized pieces. Alternatively, use a food processor to cut the butter into the flour.</li><br>
            <li>Add in the blueberries and lemon zest and toss to combine.</li><br>
            <li>Whisk together the sourdough starter, egg, and two tablespoons of milk or cream in a separate bowl.</li><br>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, then pour in the sourdough mixture. Use a fork to combine it into a shaggy dough that sticks together easily when pressed. If the mixture isn't coming together well, add a tablespoon of milk or cream if necessary, but the dough shouldn't be wet.</li><br>
            <li>Tip the shaggy dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently push it with your fingers until it is combined into a dough mound. Don&apos;t over-knead the dough, or it will become tough. Press this into an 8-inch circle.</li><br>
            <li>Cut the circle into eight wedge pieces using a knife or dough scraper. Place the pieces on baking paper and pop them into the fridge while the oven preheats. </li><br>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F.</li><br>
            <li>Brush the tops of the scones with a bit of heavy cream or milk.</li><br>
            <li>Bake the scones in the oven for around 20-25 minutes until golden brown around the edges. This timing depends on your oven. Some need longer; some need less. Once baked, leave the scones to cool before glazing.</li><br>
            <li>Add the lemon juice and enough powdered sugar until it makes a thick but pourable glaze. Drizzle it over the cooled scones.</li>
